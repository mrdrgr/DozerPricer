# DozerPricer
The AI that predicts bulldozer prices based on several factors such as usage, size and more. This project uses machine learning to give you accurate predictions in seconds.
Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and a large dataset of historical bulldozer sales, our model is able to provide accurate price predictions with minimal error.
The project is implemented in python using libraries such as Scikit Learn. In order to run install required libraries that are needed inside the main file. The dataset is also available in data folder in three different formats.
